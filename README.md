# Touchy Morse Translator üéØ

## Basic Details
### Team Name: Mosby Boys

### Team Members
- Member 1: Aaron Binoy - Saintgits College of Engineering
- Member 2: Joe George James - Saintgits College of Engineering

### Project Description
Because normal typing is too mainstream, we built a **touch-based Morse code input device** using Arduino. You tap a wire, it translates your taps into letters, and you feel like a 19th-century telegraph operator‚Ä¶ in 2025.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Keyboards have too many keys, voice typing is too fast, and we really missed the thrill of decoding dots and dashes manually.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
A touch sensor detects your taps, converts them to Morse code, and prints the decoded letters on the Serial Monitor. Basically, the slowest way to send ‚ÄúLOL‚Äù.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
**For Software:**
- Language: C++ (Arduino flavor)
- Libraries: `<Arduino.h>`, `<map>`, `<string>`
- Tools: Arduino IDE, Serial Monitor

**For Hardware:**
- ESP32 board (because more pins = more fun)
- Touch input pin (T4)
- Human finger (highly advanced tactile interface)
- USB cable to upload code & power the setup
